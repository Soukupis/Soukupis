Aspiring front-end software developer currently contributing to GraphAware Hume, the world’s only graph-powered insights engine. Trusted by Fortune 500 companies and G20 security agencies, Hume helps keep countries and communities safe, combat financial fraud, discover new medicines, and ensure regulatory compliance.
I have recently finished my engineering-focused high school studies with excellent results and I am pursuing my passion for software development and cutting-edge technologies as a software developer at GraphAware, before commencing a Software Engineering degree at Unicorn College in Prague. 
When I’m not coding or reading technical book and blogs, you will find me playing football, working out in the gym, running in city, working on my Brazilian jiu jitsu skills, baking cakes and cooking delicious food. I am a native German and Czech speaker.
